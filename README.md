# Welcome
Welcome to my GitHub space where you can find my open-source projects.

### Hmmmm, it's quite empty isn't it?
You're right, as you can see my profile is almost empty but before you speculate about my knowledge and be disappointed let me tell you something. 

Most of my work is for private clients and I can't show it without costumer's explicit permission (something that rarely happens). 

Furthermore, currently I'm moving my public projects from Bitbucket to GitHub (most of them experimets, simple tools, etc) so be patient my GitHub account will grow!

### Ok, but where I can see what you do?
If you are still interested in my work you can find it [here](https://onepopcorn.com)
